                     <p>Materiales y Transportes San Juanico is Cesar, Elena , Veronica and Ulises Gorosave and it is a local family business.</p>
                    <h2>Cesar and Elena Gorosave</h2>
                    <p>Cesar grew up on Rancho Tular in Arroyo San Ramundo (La Ballena) between San Juanico and Mulege. He and his wife Elena moved to San Juanico 30 years ago after living at Laguna San Ignacio fishing, and Punta Santo Domingo working for the Puerto Chale Cooperativo. Cesar is heavily involved with the rural community, Ejido Cadeje and head of the local truck owners union who hold concessions to work on public works projects within Commondu. Elena comes from the old Mission of Our Lady Guadalupe, east of San Juanico near Mulege. Elena, a long time resident of San Juanico has a carniceria, tienda and is involved with the Parroquia de Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe.<br></p>
                    <h2>Ulises and Vero</h2>
                    <p>Ulises fished for several years with Pto Chale Cooperativo before buying a small truck and transporting goods and sand to town. He and Vero have two boys who you will often see helping. Having built up a solid client base delivering materials, Materiales y Transportes San Juanico now has made the natural move toward opening a materials yard.</p> <br><br>   </div>
